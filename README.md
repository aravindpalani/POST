Drinking Water Treatment Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker

PROGRAMMERS NEEDED! Help develop an app to improve drinking water quality in developing nations. [AguaClara](http://aguaclara.cee.cornell.edu/) is a student-led project team that designs water treatment plants for Honduras. At AguaClara, we are building a Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker (POST) for tracking water quality data from our eleven rural treatment plants in Honduras. As part of the first AguaClara POST team, you will:

* Use the latest tools, including: NodeJS, Java, and MySQL
* Help make critical design decisions that will affect the further development of POST for years to come
* Serve a real need in Honduras alongside the rest of the AguaClara team 
* Work 9-12 hours a week in a 3-4 person team of developers for credit

We are looking for interested CS, InfoSci, or EE students. The app will be built from start to minimal viable product (MVP) during the spring semester and implemented in Honduras in early summer. Some of the challenges will be to:

* Implement a robust data-capture system that works seamlessly with intermittent internet connection and SMS
* Design an intuitive UX that displays plant performance data to operators 
* Connect the app to a custom-built Bluetooth turbidimeter
* Provide detailed recommendations for future improvements

This project will become a core part of AguaClara technology and may eventually be used throughout the world to track water treatment plant operations.
