<p>POST is the Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker that will combine a smartphone app, an inexpensive turbidimeter, and an online server and database to make water quality data easy for operators to collect and plant engineers to analyze.</p>

<a id="why-post" class="anchor" href="#why-post" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why POST?</h3>

<p>Clean drinking water is essential to human survival. Yet surprisingly little reliable data exists on the efficacy of drinking water treatment plants in developing nations. There have been few attempts to implement record keeping systems, and the returned data is often sparse and shows evidence of human error. Ideally, plant technicians would be recording and uploading plant performance data to a centrally accessible server many times a day. These measurements would enable operators to benchmark plant performance, engineers to address technical problems, municipalities to track water quality, and the foreign aid community to compile information about the effect of clean drinking water.</p>
