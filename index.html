      <p>Drinking Water Treatment Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker (POST)</p>

<p>Clean drinking water is essential to human survival. Yet surprisingly little reliable data exists on the efficacy of drinking water treatment plants in developing nations. There have been few attempts to implement record keeping systems, and the returned data is often sparse and shows evidence of human error. Ideally, plant technicians would be recording and uploading plant performance data to a centrally accessible server many times a day. These measurements would enable operators to benchmark plant performance, engineers to address technical problems, municipalities to track water quality, and the foreign aid community to compile information about the effect of clean drinking water. The proposed solution is a Plant Operations Smartphone Tracker (POST) that will combine a smartphone app, an inexpensive turbidimeter, and an online server and database to make water quality data easy for operators to collect and plant engineers to analyze. </p>

<p>POST will be implemented in conjunction with AguaClara, a research lab at Cornell University that designs water treatment plants. Currently each of the eleven AguaClara plant has trained operators who record water quality measurements a few times a day, but unfortunately the data is most often relegated to a written log book that is cumbersome and hence rarely referenced. An SMS-based reporting system was built a few years ago by a graduate student at Johns Hopkins university. Unfortunately, very few operators use the system because it was not incentivized. POST will address these problems in three ways. First, POST will be designed to have an intuitive user experience. Built in the spirit of convention over configuration, POST will enable one click data uploads, ensuring ease of use for even the most inexperienced operator. Additionally, POST will be designed to interface directly with an inexpensive handheld turbidimeter currently in design at Johns Hopkins University. Wirelessly connecting the turbidimeter to POST will facilitate a fully automated plant data collection system implemented with a collection of in-line turbidimeters in future iterations, while easing data collection in the meantime by automatically filling in turbidity measurements. Lastly, POST will display plant information directly to the operators, giving them critical insight as to the efficacy of certain procedures. That final component of POST hints at the potential of the system to evolve from a plant reporting tool into a critical operator resource. </p>

<p>Once the first iteration of POST is implemented in Honduras, there are a myriad ways it could be developed as a more effective operator resource and data collection tool. POST might collect health data such as chlorine levels of tap water or qualitative reports. POST could also facilitate the exchange of ideas and techniques between various waterboards (the water governance system currently in place in Honduras) and plant operators, and enable the purchase and sharing of bulk chemicals, tools and parts. POST might also aid with common plant calculations, house procedure training videos and refresher lessons, or even intelligently suggest plant procedures to perform at specific times based on plant data or user input. Finally, POST will be critical in demonstrating AguaClara’s ability to continuously track and understand the state of all plants built with AguaClara technology.</p>

<p>At present, the majority of the plant operators have smartphones that are connected to the internet. The capabilities of a smart-phone are critical for effectively displaying performance data, providing useful common plant calculations, and other varied components of the app that a text-based system – let alone a paper-and-pencil system – cannot begin to compete with. To develop POST, we will use several software programming best practices to ensure we produce an easily serviceable, adaptable and useful application. We will build the software modularly, which facilitates the addition of many different features and the detection of potential software bugs. Additionally, we will use the Agile Development approach to facilitate frequent adaptation of the application to the needs of the community. Lastly, POST will become open source, so other water organizations will be freely able to maintain, change and use the code. </p>

<p>Understanding past failures is critical to improving and correctly implementing POST, particularly due to the delicate nature of foreign aid. Many foreign aid projects fail because the designers of the system are too removed from the implementation of the system. Foreign aid projects also sometimes fail because the implementers pull out their support before the system becomes self-sustaining. By working with two highly successful organizations with years of experience, We’ve taken a critical precaution against early abandonment. Additionally, we plan to work with the director of AguaClara to integrate the management and development of POST into the Environmental Engineering student curriculum at Cornell, ensuring long-term support and a flow of new ideas. We believe POST has the potential to be employed throughout developing nations, providing data to improve water treatment plants, and inform the foreign aid community of the true impact of clean drinking water.</p>
